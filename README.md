# Examples
This generator is best at generating setences, but can also work with other things. Here are some examples.

## Words
The generator learned from movie lines and generated some interesting words it made:

* aly
* i
* hage
* w
* ben
* ghat
* f
* on
* bl
* fogr
* as
* juerdsa

These words look like they could maybe be real. They at least have a vowel ;).

## Math equations
I gave it some simple math equations to learn from and here's what it came up with:

+ 2 % .6.2 %
+ 96.63-.7 ^196.+ %360. 8
+ 4 5 
+ 47. 2.
+ 5 0 %230
+ 5.7 %*76.47
+ 1.8 2 ^84528

It didn't do well at math equations. It was probably because there aren't very many unique characters or words. There are only the 10 digits plus 6 operators.

## Sentences
Sentences are what this generator does best. Here are some examples.
For for the input I used the sentence "How's it going?".
Most of these sentences should make sense as a response.

* Hi.
* Mr. Gordon.
* Listen, dear. no importance, So high, anymore.
* I'm going Debbie's send
* Movies...to be married! in watch Czech piles. Jack
* Leave Stephen alone, surely.
* I've figured a shower.
* Well, the bush. and make it's paste.
* Actually, the whole face
