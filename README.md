# generate-lib
A neural-network-like procedural generation library for javascript


# Examples
This generator is best at generating snetences, but can also work with other things. Here are some examples.

## Words
The generator learned from movie lines and generated some interesting words it made:

*aly
*i
*hage
*w
*ben
*ghat
*f
*on
*bl

## Math equations
I gave it some simple math equations to learn from and here's what it came up with:

*2 % .6.2 %*
*96.63-.7 ^196.+ %360. 8*
*4 5 *
*47. 2.*
*5 0 %230*
*5.7 %*76.47*
*1.8 2 ^84528*

## Sentences
Sentences are what this generator does best. Here are some examples.
For for the input I used the sentence "How's it going?".
Most of these sentences should make sense as a response.

*Hi.
*Mr. Gordon.
*Listen, dear. no importance, So high, anymore.
*I'm going Debbie's send
*Movies...to be married! in watch Czech piles. Jack
*Leave Stephen alone, surely.
*I've figured a shower.
*Well, the bush. and make it's paste.
*Actually, the whole face
